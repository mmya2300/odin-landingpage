## Project 02: Landing Page :space_invader:	

### Overall Summary :v:

I was tasked with created a landing page based on the design given in this section of the course. I have already have experience creating a website of my own before, however this time I wanted to use what was taught in the course.

I wanted my landing page to be centered around a skin-care brand, so I researched alot of beauty websites to look at what they displayed on their page and see how I can implement it on my page.

Overall, I learned alot with this assignment and I'm getting more and more comfortable at the design aspect of web development and can't wait to go to the next section.
