## Project 02: Landing Page :space_invader:	

### Overall Summary :v:

I was tasked with creating a landing page based on the design in the course section. I have already had experience creating a website of my own before. However, I wanted to use what was taught in the course this time.

I wanted my landing page to be centered around a skin-care brand, so I researched many beauty websites to look at what they displayed on their page and see how I could implement it.

Overall, I learned a lot with this assignment, and I'm getting more and more comfortable with the design aspect of web development and can't wait to go to the next section.
